# BlockArcade

## 01 Introduction

Our goal with BlockArcade is to emulate the traditional arcade experience, just on the decentralized web! This vision includes arcade tokens using IOST, tickets for prizes using a custom token called TIX, and a prize counter to spend your tickets!

Currently our ideas for prizes are:

* IOST!
* Unique digital art using non-fungible tokens on IOST.
* Other IOST IRC20 coins with partner dApps.




## 02 Games

### StaveWave 

StackWave is the first game we plan to launch on BlockArcade with more games planned in the future.

StaveWave is currently live on the IOST mainnet at:
https://blockarca.de

The idea is simple: Tap or click the grid to place the row of blocks. Any blocks that aren’t aligned with the previous row’s blocks are lost and removed. 

The goal is to reach the top row with at least one block!

Once the game is live on the mainnet there will be prizes for reaching the minor prize line at row 8, and the major prize line at row 12.
Please try the game and let us know how far you get in our Telegram room! According to our data, no one has managed to hit the jackpot yet.
