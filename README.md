# BlockArcade

## 01 Introduction

Our goal with BlockArcade is to emulate the traditional arcade experience, just on the decentralized web! This vision includes arcade tokens using IOST, tickets for prizes using a custom token called TIX, and a prize counter to spend your tickets!

## 02 Games

### StaveWave 

StackWave is the first game we plan to launch on BlockArcade with more games planned in the future.

StaveWave is currently live on the IOST mainnet at:
https://blockarca.de

The idea is simple: Tap or click the grid to place the row of blocks. Any blocks that aren’t aligned with the previous row’s blocks are lost and removed. 

The goal is to reach the top row with at least one block!

At row 8 you'll be giving the option to take the minor prize (1.2x inserted amount) or go for the jackpot (10% of the contract balance). 

Currently StaveWave accepts IOST in increments of 10, 100, or 1000. Pay 100 or more to go for the major jackpot which is 10% of the contract balance. Pay 10 IOST to go for the minor jackpot which is 1%

At the time of writing the IOST put into StackWave is distributed in this fashion:

* 1.2% goes to an IOST account managed by the developers, batreas. Currently we're auto-voting all of those funds to our IOST node, blockarcade. 
* 74.1% goes to the jackpot. This is kept in the StackWave contract. 
* 24.7% goes to the TIX contract to issue TIX to the user. 

We have no plans to change the 1.2% developer cut, but we may tweak the amount going to the jackpot or TIX contract in the future. 

StackWave payouts 1 TIX for every IOST spent playing. Users that choose to go for the major jackpot will be rewarded with a 2x payout on TIX. 

## TIX Token

TIX is the digital equivalent to tickets from an arcade. TIX is meant to reward users for playing BlockArcade games. 

TIX is an IRC20 token implemented on the IOST blockchain. 

TIX is exchangeable for IOST through the TIX contract at a rate of 10 TIX = 1 IOST. 

TIX total supply is 21,000,000,000. 

## Prize counter

The prize counter is where you can exchange TIX for prizes, similar to a traditional arcade. This is where you'll be able to trade TIX for IOST, and more. 

Currently our ideas for prizes are:

* IOST!
* Unique digital art using non-fungible tokens on IOST.
* Other IOST IRC20 coins with partner dApps.
* BlockArcade swag (shirts, stickers). 

You will also be able to trade TIX for unique collectible art pieces created by artists either in the community, or in Austin, TX. These will be implemented as non-fungible tokens in the IOST blockchain using the IRC721 standard. 

Our goal is to emulate the arcade as much as possible by providing a wide array of options for exchanging TIX. Any IOST left over in the TIX contract will be used for airdrops and other promotional events.
